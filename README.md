This is a simple 9am-5pm work day scheduler I have built that showcases some of the core skills I have learnt in week 5 of the MONU coding bootcamp, specifically in integrating third-party APIs (in this case, dayjs) into functional web applications.

## Usage

The application is automatically colour-coded based on the local time of your device. In the header, it displays the current day. You may click on the appropriate input box to manually type in any events/appointments you may have at the associated time. Clicking the blue save button next to that box will save the inserted items to that timeslot. An alert will confirm this. To remove items from timeslots, you may simply click on said timeslot and delete said items, then click the blue save button once again. An alert will confirm your items have been cleared.

To view the source code of the webpage, open Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see the source code of the webpage.
